/**
 * Signals that there are enough outstanding cell requests that it is worth
 * terminating this phase of execution and asking the segment cache for all of
 * the cells that have been asked for.
 *
 * Not really an exception, just a way of aborting a process so that we can do
 * some work and restart the process. Any code that handles this exception is
 * typically in a loop that calls mondrian.rolap.RolapResult#phase.
 *
 *
 * There are several advantages to this:
 *
 * If the query has been run before, the cells will be in the cache already, and
 * this is an opportunity to copy them into the local cache. If cell requests
 * are for the same or similar cells, it gives opportunity to fetch these cells.
 * Then the requests can be answered from local cache, and we don't need to
 * bother the cache manager with similar requests. Prevents memory from filling
 * up with cell requests.
