/**
 * The contract of the MDX function {@code ParamRef(<String>)}, which returns the current
 * value of a query parameter declared elsewhere via {@code Parameter(...)}.
 *
 * <p>{@code ParamRefResolver.createFunDef} used to call {@code
 * ParameterFunDef.getParameterName(args)} unconditionally, which throws {@code
 * Util.newInternal("Parameter name must be a string constant")} whenever {@code args[0]} is
 * not a string {@code Literal} — a precondition only the parser guarantees for real {@code
 * ParamRef('x')} MDX. Since {@code createFunDef} is reached from {@code
 * AbstractMetaDataMultiResolver.resolve()} once the generic type/category check already
 * matches, this made {@code resolve()} throw instead of returning {@code Optional.empty()}
 * for any Name argument that is STRING-typed but not a literal — this test kit's stub-based
 * probing ({@code TypedExpressionStub}) is never a {@code Literal}, so every probed call hit
 * this. Fixed to check {@code args[0] instanceof Literal} itself and return {@code null}
 * (declining the match) instead of throwing — see {@code CallAssert.resolutionDoesNotThrow}'s
 * "resolve() must be a pure predicate" rule. Real {@code ParamRef("Foo")} MDX is unaffected
 * (the parser always produces a literal there); {@code QueryImpl} still raises a proper
 * diagnosed error later for a genuinely non-literal Name in real validation.
 *
 * <p>That fix is necessary but not sufficient to let generic stub-based resolution probing
 * (promises 3/4/6's declared-vs-accepted comparisons) exercise this atom meaningfully: no
 * stub this test kit can construct is ever a {@code Literal}, so the resolver now declines
 * every probed call cleanly rather than crashing on it — {@code resolvesDeclaredCalls} and
 * {@code declaredSignatureMatchesAcceptedCalls} are waived for the same reason {@link
 * AsContract} waives them (a real precondition only the parser can satisfy), though unlike
 * {@code AsAliasResolver}'s crash, the fix above means {@code survivesEdgeCases}' stub sweep
 * now runs unwaived and green: {@code resolve()} no longer throws for any probed shape.
 *
 * <p>RESULT/DEPENDENCIES/RESULT_SHAPE are also waived: {@code ParameterFunDef.compileCall}
 * throws {@code UnsupportedOperationException} unconditionally — a {@code ParamRef} call is
 * never compiled directly, it is rewritten during validation ({@code createCall}) into a
 * {@code ParameterExpressionImpl} wrapping a real query {@code Parameter}, machinery this
 * test kit's cube-free Stage A cannot exercise and whose real behavior depends on a query
 * actually declaring the referenced parameter via {@code Parameter(...)} — a fixture this
 * module has no schema to provide (same reasoning as the KPI accessor family, e.g. {@link
 * KPIGoalContract}), and moot regardless since this module never reaches Stage B.
