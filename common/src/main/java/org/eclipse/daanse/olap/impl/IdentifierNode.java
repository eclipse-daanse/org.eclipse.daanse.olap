/**
 * Multi-part identifier.
 *
 * An identifier is immutable.
 *
 * An identifer consists of one or more {@link IdentifierSegment}s. A segment
 * is either:
 * An unquoted value such as '{@code CA}',
 * A value quoted in brackets, such as '{@code [San Francisco]}', or
 * A key of one or more parts, each of which is prefixed with '&amp;',
 *     such as '{@code &amp;[Key 1]&amp;Key2&amp;[5]}'.
 *
 *
 * Segment types are indicated by the Quoting enumeration.
 *
 * A key segment is of type Quoting#KEY, and has one or more
 * component parts accessed via the
 * IdentifierSegment#getKeyParts() method. The parts
 * are of type Quoting#UNQUOTED or Quoting#QUOTED.
 *
 * A simple example is the identifier Measures.[Unit Sales]. It
 * has two segments:
 * Segment #0 is
 *     Quoting#UNQUOTED UNQUOTED,
 *     name "Measures"
 * Segment #1 is
 *     Quoting#QUOTED QUOTED,
 *     name "Unit Sales"
 *
 *
 * A more complex example illustrates a compound key. The identifier {@code
 * [Customers].[City].&amp;[San Francisco]&amp;CA&amp;USA.&amp;[cust1234]}
 * contains four segments as follows:
 *
 * Segment #0 is QUOTED, name "Customers"
 * Segment #1 is QUOTED, name "City"
 * Segment #2 is a Quoting#KEY KEY.
 *     It has 3 sub-segments:
 *
 *     Sub-segment #0 is QUOTED, name "San Francisco"
 *     Sub-segment #1 is UNQUOTED, name "CA"
 *     Sub-segment #2 is UNQUOTED, name "USA"
 *
 *
 * Segment #3 is a KEY. It has 1 sub-segment:
 *
 *     Sub-segment #0 is QUOTED, name "cust1234"
 *
