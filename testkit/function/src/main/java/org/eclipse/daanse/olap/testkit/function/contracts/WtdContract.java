/**
 * The contract of the MDX function {@code Wtd(<Member>)} — a shortcut for {@code
 * PeriodsToDate(<Level Week>, <Member>)}: {@code WtdMultiResolver} wraps a single {@code
 * XtdFunDef} bound to {@code LevelType.TIME_WEEKS}, the same shape {@link MtdContract}
 * documents in full for {@code LevelType.TIME_MONTHS} — see that contract's Javadoc for the
 * resolver-safety and Stage-A/B reasoning shared by the whole {@code Mtd}/{@code Qtd}/
 * {@code Wtd}/{@code Ytd} family.
 *
 * <p>Unlike {@link MtdContract}/{@link QtdContract}, no assertion here names a concrete
 * Week-level member: the {@code [Time]} default hierarchy this test kit's fixture is known to
 * use for Month/Quarter (Year &gt; Quarter &gt; Month) has no Week level at all — a real Week
 * hierarchy, if this fixture even declares one, would be a differently-shaped, unverified
 * hierarchy this module has no schema resource to confirm. RESULT and RESULT_SHAPE are waived
 * outright (no member this contract can safely name, and no known value for the zero-arg form
 * either without a real query context); the zero-argument form needs no member reference, so
 * it is the only DEPENDENCIES case exercised below (mirroring {@code
 * XtdWithoutMemberCalc.dependsOn}'s "depends on every Time-typed hierarchy" override that
 * {@link MtdContract} documents in full).
