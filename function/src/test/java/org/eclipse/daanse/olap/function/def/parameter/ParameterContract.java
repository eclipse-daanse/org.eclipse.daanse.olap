/**
 * The contract of the MDX function {@code Parameter(<Name>, <Type>, <DefaultValue>[,
 * <Description>])}, which declares a query parameter — eight overloads, one triple
 * ({@code Type} category, {@code DefaultValue} category, return category) per parameter kind:
 * NUMERIC/STRING (via a {@code NUMERIC}/{@code STRING} {@code Symbol} literal for {@code
 * Type}) or a dimension/hierarchy/level (a {@code Member} default) or a set (a {@code Set}
 * default), each with an optional trailing {@code Description}. No single return category
 * applies across all eight (same reasoning as {@link StarContract}), so none is declared.
 *
 * <p>{@code ParameterResolver.createFunDef} — reached from {@code
 * AbstractMetaDataMultiResolver.resolve()} once the generic type/category match against one
 * of the eight overloads already succeeds — used to have two crash points fixed here, the
 * same "resolve() must be a pure predicate" violation {@link ParamRefContract} found and
 * fixed in the sibling {@code ParamRef} function (both share {@code
 * ParameterFunDef.getParameterName}):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code getParameterName(args)} threw {@code Util.newInternal(...)} whenever {@code
 *       args[0]} (the parameter Name) was not a string {@code Literal} — fixed identically to
 *       {@code ParamRefResolver}: {@code createFunDef} now checks {@code args[0] instanceof
 *       Literal} itself and returns {@code null} (declines the match) instead.
 *   <li>The {@code SYMBOL} branch (for the NUMERIC/STRING {@code Type} argument) cast {@code
 *       typeArg} to {@code Literal} unconditionally — {@code ClassCastException} for any
 *       SYMBOL-typed argument the parser did not itself produce as a literal. Fixed the same
 *       way: an {@code instanceof} check that declines the match instead of casting blindly.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Those two fixes are not sufficient to make generic stub-based resolution probing safe
 * for this atom, though — {@code createFunDef} has several more throw points past them that
 * a real precondition only the parser satisfies, not a rewrite this contract attempts:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The {@code DIMENSION}/{@code HIERARCHY}/{@code LEVEL} {@code Type} branch requires
 *       {@code ParameterFunDef.isConstant(typeArg)} — true only for a handful of concrete AST
 *       node shapes ({@code LevelExpression}, {@code HierarchyExpressionImpl}, {@code
 *       DimensionExpression}, or a specific {@code Hierarchy(CurrentMember(...))} call) — and
 *       throws a diagnosed {@code OlapRuntimeException} otherwise; a generic stub is none of
 *       those shapes.
 *   <li>The default-value argument is cross-checked against the resolved parameter type
 *       (dimension/hierarchy/level consistency) and throws on a mismatch a stub cannot avoid
 *       triggering meaningfully.
 *   <li>A supplied {@code Description} argument must itself be a string {@code Literal} or it
 *       throws — the same shape of precondition as the Name fix above, just not fixed here
 *       (this one is response-shape validation deep in default-value semantics, not a bare
 *       unguarded cast).
 * </ul>
 * RESOLUTION, SIGNATURE and EDGE are waived for the combined reason above — the same
 * "generic stub probing cannot supply a real precondition-satisfying AST node" situation
 * {@link AsContract} documents for {@code AsAliasResolver}, just spread across more throw
 * points here instead of one.
 *
 * <p>RESULT/DEPENDENCIES/RESULT_SHAPE are waived too: {@code ParameterFunDef.compileCall}
 * throws {@code UnsupportedOperationException} unconditionally — a {@code Parameter} call is
 * never compiled directly, it is rewritten during validation ({@code createCall}) into a real
 * query {@code Parameter} object, the same reasoning {@link ParamRefContract} gives (their
 * {@code FunDef} classes are identical on this point).
