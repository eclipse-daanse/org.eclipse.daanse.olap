/**
 * A Member is a 'point' on a dimension of a cube. Examples are
 * [Time].[1997].[January],
 * [Customer].[All Customers],
 * [Customer].[USA].[CA],
 * [Measures].[Unit Sales].
 *
 * Every member belongs to a  Level of a  Hierarchy. Members
 * except the root member have a parent, and members not at the leaf level have one or more children.
 *
 * Measures are a special kind of member. They belong to their own
 * dimension, [Measures].
 *
 * There are also special members representing the 'All' value of a
 * hierarchy, the null value, and the error value.
 *
 * Members can have member properties. Their  Level#getProperties
 * defines which are allowed.
